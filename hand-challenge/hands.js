ðŸ‘‰ : moves the memory pointer to the next cell
ðŸ‘ˆ : moves the memory pointer to the previous cell
ðŸ‘† : increment the memory cell at the current position
ðŸ‘‡ : decreases the memory cell at the current position.
ðŸ¤œ : if the memory cell at the current position is 0, jump just after the corresponding ðŸ¤›
ðŸ¤› : if the memory cell at the current position is not 0, jump just after the corresponding ðŸ¤œ
ðŸ‘Š : Display the current character represented by the ASCII code defined by the current position.
